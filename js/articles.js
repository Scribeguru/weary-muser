    '<span class="dropcap">A</span>t some point you wake up in the cockpit of the ship. Whether you’re coasting lazily twixt the channels of Venice, or through the Arctic ice-fields plowing towards catastrophe — you come into the situation consciously and make an assessment. Instantaneously a cognitive map containing yourself, the ship, and your surroundings, is constructed — and the time to make a decision is forced upon you.<br><br>From this juncture, you’re at liberty to do an infinite number of things, but you absolutely must select one — even if it fits the dictionary definition of “nothing”. From this point forth there is never a time in which you can sit with the decision making process without simultaneously polluting yourself with the decision to analyze the others. In other words, there is no physical way to look at the potential decisions at hand and select the most rational one, because to do so would require you to go beyond all of them into a state of almost non-existence. Even to be “indecisive”, then, is effectively a decision.<br><br>Obviously in the context of the ship, your course of action will largely depend on your past, and how you’ve managed similar circumstances. But have you ever considered whether it makes any sense to do such a thing? If instead of a ship, you consider your first conscious moment in the maternity ward, and the fact that you were making decisions every moment even <em>then</em> — what becomes apparent is that the basis for all the decisions you’re making in this moment, are effectively the sum of those you were making as a seven and-a-half pound lump of drooling flesh. From that foundation, you derive your concept of what is and what is not rational in terms of how you proceed through life — and every person that has ever existed before you, <em>did the same</em>.<br><br>So whether you’re hurtling towards an icy coffin, or leisurely drifting under a footbridge, just know that whatever you decide to do — it makes absolutely no sense, and since we don’t actually possess the cognitive faculties necessary to determine whether that’s okay or not, the only <em>real</em> decision of any importance to make at the end of the day, is how you’re going to feel about it.' +
