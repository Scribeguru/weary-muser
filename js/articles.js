      'You know what to do the same way a waterfall knows to descend off its precipice, and how a spider knows to spin its web. All your striving and all your doubt - the combined work of an incalculable number of separate moments each with their own isolated context and purpose, are not in their totality obligated to explain themselves, and as such they never do; but they are as dignified in their being as the Swiss Alps are in theirs, and as reliable in what progress they attain to as fingernails left unclipped.<br /><br />To see that fundamental guiding wisdom which crafts the scientifically inexplicable aerodynamics of avian wings, and what makes the sands the perfect surface whereupon the sea may kiss the land and harbor the vast plethora of intertidal creatures, then shy away from the implication that that force could not but reside inside your own self - is to blush and run from the one you love for fear of hoping what you wish may very actually be. Is it not evidence enough that a stone <em>is</em>, the same way you <em>are</em>? Nothing could be simpler, but we play the playwrights in this existential drama so well, that, illusorily pedestalizing ourselves to assume the burden of the entire orchestration, we fancy we are smote beyond recovery from shouldering some such weight - even just lounging in a chair.<br /><br />So we tense up and fret and shake our fists at the mad synechdoche we are, (for the whole of being is manifest anywhere you care to look, including within.) ignoring, perhaps for the sake of effect, that to deliberate over the necessity of our deliberations - is for a bird to chirp in panic over the structural integrity of the sky, <em>while soaring through it</em>.<br /><br />The sky is gifted to the birds with no expectation of recompense, as a birthright. The higher order processes of human beings is a gift of the same nature. It is passable for a fledgling to fear what lay beyond the nest, but you ask after the price tag in the face of your ineffable benefactor when you refuse to exercise your birthright with conviction once the recalcitrant, cyclical bedrock of existential inquiry has been gracelessly struck by your fearful pickaxe for the eleven hundredth time.<br /><br />The responsibility of an ant to its hill is no small thing.'

      'There is a disturbingly thin line between the disgusting and the refined — and a sort of countersteering action in place between the two which is mechanistically similar to the Christian model of repentance. Illustrated somewhat crudely: Those who consider themselves disgusting approach refinement, and those who consider themselves refined are disgusting. A kind of walking backwards in the attempt at becoming less disgusting or sinful, where at the moment when stepping back becomes a conscious action, the knees of the individual walking instantaneously invert like some sort of horrible fleshy moral compass protesting the traversal of an invisible equator.<br><br>The only way out of this bind is to become to yourself so slippery — so legitimately disgusting, that you effectively force the needle to the opposite side from the perspective of everyone around you. In other words, you have to abandon the pursuit of manifesting your personal concept of purity and every connotation associated with it whole-heartedly, and live as though the hour has struck where all the bets are off, without a care in the universe as to whether anyone’s opinion of your character or taste has any repercussions. A total and complete dive into whatever your genuine conception of depravity is, is the only thing that can save you once you gaze into the abyss that is this unintuitive dichotomy.<br><br>If somewhere in the process of your deliberate foray into darkness you lose the fiendish enthusiasm of one who’s spotted a shiny object in an empty home, you immediately become exactly as disgusting as you perceived the action to be. Have fun sorting that out. (No seriously, or you’ll mess it up.)'

      'Being satisfied with an answer has little to do with having arrived at a logically acceptable conclusion — and more to do with the merciful cessation of an intellectual dissection whose inertia would otherwise carry it out indefinitely. Parents (re-) learn this when their children come to be about four years old, and enter the proverbial <em>Why Phase</em>. The Why Phase is regarded as everything from cute, to remarkable, to mind-numbingly frustrating — but always as something out of which every functional person is expected to grow.<br><br>The completely natural phenomenon of the Why Phase never actually leaves the brain, however. A quick test will reveal it’s simply tucked under the surface, <em>just</em> beneath the veil of personality. You start with any explanation, and find that without much struggle — the question, “why?”, can be asked in perfectly good faith until you run out of language. It’s interesting that we acknowledge this natural inquisitive capacity to be so unwieldy that it’s of imperative social necessity to relegate its verbal manifestation to little more than youth and/or isolation — but at the same time we demand its exercise whenever anything of importance is being discussed.<br><br>At the very best this is a hilarious contradiction to watch unfold if you’re bearing witness to an argument between two people who’ve forgotten there are no coordinates to the bottom of the rabbit hole, and at the worst — it gets people ostracized, persecuted, and killed. When we treat logical analysis as an end in itself in the theatre of decision-making as it pertains to large groups especially, one half of what makes us fundamentally human is swept under the rug and stamped out. The terms to describe that half usually take on names like intuition, common sense, social-graces, etc. All the things of importance when the glue that holds people together is what’s at stake.<br><br>I love a clean, logical process of thinking and explaining phenomena just as much as the next person, but trying to make it the holy grail to which all should aspire on every front is suggesting that the tail should wag the dog. A car\'s engine does not exist for its own sake save for in special environments dedicated to its bleeding edge expression. Similarly, intellectual prowess has its domain, and it’s imperative that the Why Phase <em>continue</em> to be siphoned accordingly — just as much because of what deleterious potential it can possess, as because the promise it holds is too valuable to be squandered in settings where it isn’t welcome.<br><br> When the world’s thinkers have no direction — they mold and carve their surroundings to taste. The intellect is too corrosive for this to happen uncoordinated for any length of time with the expectation that the integral structures of the society hosting it might remain uninjured. We must allow and encourage our thinkers to have their spaces, or be ready to continue riding waves of cultural upheaval as they arrive.'

      'Every day a challenge. You wake up and fight the sleep out of your eyes, meander into the kitchen, and concoct a potent brown elixir to force your brain into a state of alertness against its will. Drape clothes over your limbs despite the protest of your stiff muscles, and breathe heavily through the entire process — straining to focus on the various tasks at hand instead of the discomfort they bring you. Once you’re ready, you head out the door into a world which reveals itself day after day to be the essence of what your arduous mornings are a microcosm of.<br><br>You might feel embarrassed in the presence of any of your distant ancestors, with all your creature comforts and technology — but the truth is they would laugh at your anxiety if they’d the means to know you. If their shoes were yours, they’d be doing the same dance. So why all the strife? What have you to prove? For nothing more than to avoid the discontentment of your peers you bleed and scrape and weep for a future whose inhabitants will look back on you with the same embarrassment — which you’d of course regard with the humorous reassurance of your own predecessors, for if their shoes were yours, <em>you’d</em> be doing the same dance. And so the dance goes on and on.<br><br>But humans solve problems. It’s what we do — it’s been too long since the days of hunting, rest, and survival, for us to understand how to do anything else, and we’d been coasting under the momentum of our initial civilizing leaps for too long before we had the wherewithal to see them as just exactly what we’d been doing prior — only in a different flavor. We are the most recent generations of a virus that complexifies things for its own sake. Ever-defining new problems by way of dividing what we know and categorizing it, only to proceed to be dissatisfied with whatever we’ve decided it represents — before dissecting the lot again and reconfiguring it until it’s deemed sorted. (For the time being.) We know every “solution” we implement is provisional, and yet we go on like mad with the things until we perish, praying that our children take up whichever arbitrary torch we chose to carry through life.<br><br>Any length of analysis will reveal that as a species we are essentially like an eight billion person sized toddler, playing with its hands — each of which possesses a sock with a face drawn on, and myriad intentions. There can never be a winner — just more or different rules. What to do, what to do? Well, I write this blog. And I do a little dance every once in a while, study for a significant chunk of time, and eat a sandwich in the middle of the day. There is no mystery unless you create one — and if you don’t like mysteries, there’s a trillion other means of exercising your complexifying nature that might suit you better. At the very least, maybe try to have a pleasant time doing it. I know I do.'

There is a transcendent calmness about him which comforts and reassures every being he comes into contact with. His patience is impenetrable, and his discipline as consistent and unwavering as the cycles of the universe. He is measured, but not anxious — supremely peaceful, but never lazy. When he makes a mistake, he corrects himself swiftly and gently, taking care to sow no further discord in his environment or in himself. It\'s as though he experiences his entire life as a lucid dream — infinitely aware, so that the only tension which ever beseiges him is that which he is keen to invite upon himself.'

      'At some point you wake up in the cockpit of the ship. Whether you’re coasting lazily twixt the channels of Venice, or through the Arctic ice-fields plowing towards catastrophe — you come into the situation consciously and make an assessment. Instantly a cognitive map containing yourself, the ship, and your surroundings, is constructed — and the time to make a decision is forced upon you.<br><br>From this juncture, you’re at liberty to do an infinite number of things, but you absolutely must select one — even if it fits the dictionary definition of “nothing”. Moving forward — there is never a time in which you can sit with the decision making process without simultaneously polluting yourself with the decision to analyze the others. In other words, there is no physical way to look at the potential decisions at hand and select the most rational one, because to do so would require you to go beyond all of them into a state of almost non-existence. Even to be “indecisive”, then, is effectively a decision.<br><br>Obviously in the context of the ship, your course of action will largely depend on your past, and how you’ve managed similar circumstances. But have you ever considered whether it makes any sense to do such a thing? If instead of a ship, you consider your first conscious moment in the maternity ward, and the fact that you were making decisions every moment even <em>then</em> — what becomes apparent is that the bases for all the decisions you’re making in this moment, are little more than the sum of those you were making as a seven and-a-half pound lump of drooling flesh. From that foundation you derive your concept of what is and what is not rational in terms of how you proceed through life — and every person that has ever existed before you, <em>did the same</em>.<br><br>So whether you’re hurtling towards an icy coffin, or leisurely drifting under a footbridge, just know that whatever you decide to do — it makes absolutely no sense, and since we don’t possess the cognitive faculties necessary to determine whether that’s okay or not, the only <em>real</em> decision of any importance to make at the end of the day, is how you’re going to feel about it.'
